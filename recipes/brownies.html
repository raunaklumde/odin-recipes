    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These cake-like brownies are the most delicious, fudgy treats that I have ever eaten. They are so moist and super quick and easy to make. For best results, use Dutch-processed cocoa. For less cake-like brownies, use all-purpose flour instead of self-rising.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8x8- or 9x9-inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Beat together sugar and butter in a medium bowl. Add eggs and mix well. Combine flour, cocoa, and salt; stir into sugar mixture. Mix in vanilla, then stir in walnuts. Spread evenly into the prepared pan</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool before cutting into squares.</li>
